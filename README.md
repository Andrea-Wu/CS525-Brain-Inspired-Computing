This is my implementation of Rutgers CS 425 - Brain-Inspired Computing
assignments.

Assignmnent 1 required us to simulate the electric potential of neurons using 
three types of models: the Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF), Hodgkinâ€“Huxley (HH),
and Izhikevich.

Assignment 2 required us implement/train a SNN using one of the neuron models
above, to be able to predict the output of an XOR gate. Honestly the process
behind this was so experimental/random that it made me no longer want to do ML.
In the directory are a lot of iterations of the model weights before I got
them to converge.
